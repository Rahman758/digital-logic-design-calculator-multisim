# digital-logic-design-calculator-multisim
A digital logic design project of a binary calculator simulated in NI Multisim, implementing addition and subtraction using logic gates and 7-segment display.
# 🔢 Calculator Project in Multisim

This project simulates a simple digital calculator using **NI Multisim**, designed to perform basic binary addition and subtraction operations.

## 🧠 Overview

The calculator is built using:
- 4-bit binary adder/subtractor logic
- Logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)
- 7-segment display for result visualization
- Control signals for operation selection (Add/Sub)

## 📁 Project Files

- `circuit.ms14` – Main Multisim circuit file
- `/screenshots/` – Images showing the circuit and simulation
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **NI Multisim**
- Digital Logic Components (TTL)
- 7-Segment Displays

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.ms14` file in Multisim.
2. Power on the simulation.
3. Enter binary inputs (A and B).
4. Toggle control signal to select Add/Sub.
5. View result on 7-segment display.
